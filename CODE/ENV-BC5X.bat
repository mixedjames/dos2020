@REM   NOTES: (because I don't do this stuff very often any more)
@REM     - START command allows use to start DOSBox without leaving another
@REM       Command Prompt open cluttering up the taskbar
@REM     - Empty quotes are intentional - this would be the title of the new
@REM       Command Prompt window but since it doesn't stick about we don't care
@REM     - Lack of quotes around the DOXBox path is correct! (Turns out I've
@REM       been doing this wrong for years...)
