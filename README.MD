# DOS2020

My efforts in programming for DOS in the present day (2021 as of writing this)

Please see [https://mixedjames.github.io/code](https://mixedjames.github.io/code)
and search ```DOS2020``` for more documentation.

## The main directories

```
./
  CODE  - Projects live here
  H     - Headers for the JLIB library live here
  LIB   - .LIB files for the JLIB library
  BUILD - Common Makefiles live here
```

## Some rules to make understanding the project easier

1. All files are in uppercase and observe the 8.3 limit
2. Each major directory (the root & it's direct descendants, and each project
   directory) contains a README.MD
3. (Optional) See [https://mixedjames.github.io/code](https://mixedjames.github.io/code)
   for my thinking & why things are they way they are
